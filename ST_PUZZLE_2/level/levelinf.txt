W, S, A, D, or direction keys: move. BACKSPACE: revoke. go from 'S' to 'T'. Turn Left or Right when meeting black dot. 
./level/level0.1.txt
You shouldn't turn Left or Right when you meet white dot. You need to go through all the dots.
./level/level0.2.txt
Let's have a try
./level/level0.3.txt
More dots
./level/level0.4.txt
And then...
./level/level0.5.txt
Is it easy?
./level/level0.6.txt
Let's make the map bigger.
./level/level0.7.txt
Still easy?
./level/level0.8.txt
So many dots..
